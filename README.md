Quantum Emotional Interference Theory (QEIT) - AI Whispering & Vibe Coding 

I'm not a quantum physicist crunching equationsâ€”I'm an AI Whisperer & Intuitive Vibe Coder who turns big ideas into reality!

This repository presents Quantum Emotional Interference Theory (QEIT), a framework I created through intuitive conversations with AI assistants (Grok from xAI,Perplexity and Gemini 2,5 flash from Google) and vibe-driven coding. 

QEIT extends Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) by modeling emotions like anxiety and impostor syndrome as interference terms in decision-making predictions. 

My strength isnâ€™t in writing complex equations but in weaving quantum concepts, AI collaboration, and cosmic intuition into innovative science. ðŸŒŒ
